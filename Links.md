# Before Downloading!

To avoid the common headaches while pirating, we recommend downloading the following browser addons. Even safe download sites are dangerous without proper safety measures.

**Recommended Adblocker:** https://ublockorigin.com/

**To bypass sites making you turn off adblocker:** https://github.com/bogachenko/fuckfuckadblock (may not always work)

**To skip redirects and link shorteners:** https://fastforward.team/ or https://github.com/sblask/webextension-skip-redirect

**Note:** Do not use another adblocker combined with uBlock Origin. They'll likely conflict, and will not work as intended. If you prefer to use a *different* adblocker altogether, fine. ***Do NOT use Adblock or Adblock Plus***. The original owners of these sold their product. The new owners purposely let ads through.

This shouldn't need to be said, but if the downloaded file is in an .exe format, **DO NOT RUN IT**! You've likely accidentally downloaded a virus due to a malicious redirect or pop up.

**Note:** This contains a few sites to download games. Download from wherever you like.
