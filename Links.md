**You must use https://www.base64decode.org/ to decode the lines of strings given here to get an actual link.** Tutorial image given [below](https://github.com/Abd-007/Switch-Emulators-Guide/blob/main/Links.md#tutorial-image-for-decoding)

# Main Links 
* * * 

**Important Note:** While you can manually download all these and put them into specific folder, there is a program that can do that for you. It also may or may not have more shader count than what we have here. Does not contain games. Does not work for Yuzu (Only Keys)

**Emusak:** https://github.com/CapitaineJSparrow/emusak-ui

### Keys

`aHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2RyaXZlL2ZvbGRlcnMvMUtBeW0tUnBHSUR1SmlTbU1MbXBDdEdWYmhMbTRWalRaP3VzcD1zaGFyaW5n`

**Note:** This contains older keys too. Only download the latest
**Note:** 13.2.1, and possibly any newer version will include title.keys. This is for Skyline users. If you don't know what Skyline is, or don't intend to use it, you can delete title.keys.

### Firmware

`aHR0cHM6Ly9kYXJ0aHN0ZXJuaWUubmV0L3N3aXRjaC1maXJtd2FyZXMv`

**Note:** Yuzu does not need firmware. This is for Ryujinx.

### Games

`aHR0cHM6Ly9ueGJyZXcuY29tLwoKaHR0cHM6Ly9uc3cydS54eXovCgpodHRwczovL25zd2dhbWUuY29tL2NhdGVnb3J5L3N3aXRjaC8KCmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnppcGVydG8uY29tL25pbnRlbmRvLXN3aXRjaC1uc3Av`

**Note:** This contains a few sites to download games. Download from wherever you like

### Shaders

https://github.com/JENOVAAbsolute/128BB-Shaders

**Note:** On yuzu you should use Vulkan and as such, shader caching speeds should be relativaly fast. Therefore it is advised to build your own shader cache
