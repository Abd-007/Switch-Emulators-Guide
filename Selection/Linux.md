## You've reached a point where you're free to choose which emulator you would like to use. AMD and Intel are fine on both emulators as they have MESA drivers, and Nvidia is also fine with either emulator.

Now, you're left with a choice. You can choose to use Ryujinx or Yuzu. You can read below to see the pros and cons of each. We recommend using Ryujinx because of the reasons listed below and more. However, if you know what you're really looking for, choose from these options:

## Differences between Yuzu and Ryujinx

**Yuzu:**

**Pros:**
- Better performance, so It's ideal for weaker PCs

**Cons:**
- It's based off 3DS code, so both accuracy and stability are awful. This is being rectified over time
- They use code stolen from Ryujinx, and claim it as their own
- Gives performance via CPU hacks, which makes the stability even worse
- Devs focus on 1st party and popular games, so a lot of games are very buggy or unplayable.
- Limited Amiibo support
- Can't create mii characters
- Vulkan shaders are largely non-transferrable
- AMD GPU users experience graphical bugs Nvidia does not get

**Ryujinx:**

**Pros:**
- Built from scratch, and actually emulates Switch hardware.
- Accurate (less bugs)
- Stable (less crashes)
- Can play a lot more games
- Has multiplayer support with other Ryujinx users (separate build).
- Full Amiibo support with everything built-in
- Has a built-in Mii creator

**Cons:**
- Slightly more demanding, as it doesn't rely on unstable hacks 
- Vulkan is currently in its own testing build, as it's still being worked on
- AMD support is very limited

**What do they both have?**
- Res scaling
- Support for almost any kind of controller (some require 3rd party software)
- OpenGL and Vulkan support
