## You've reached a point where you're free to choose which emulator you would like to use. AMD and Intel are fine on both emulators as they have MESA drivers, and Nvidia is also fine with either emulator.

Now, you're left with a choice. You can choose to use Ryujinx or Yuzu. You can read below to see the advantages and disadvantages of each. However, if you know what you're really looking for, choose from these options:

Still unsure? Here's reasons to use Ryujinx over Yuzu:

- Better stability
- Better compatibility
- A higher accuracy
- Amiibo support
- Has LDN functionality

Here's reasons to use Yuzu over Ryujinx:

- Runs slightly better, especially on lower end hardware
- Has multiple rendering APIs in the main build

Both support:

- Playing commercial switch games (obviously)
- Resolution scaling
- A wide range of controller support
- LAN play for the dozen or so games that support it
