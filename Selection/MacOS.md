## MacOS support is very limited. We do not recommend using it

However, if you still want to try it for any reason, you can download it at https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/pull/2518 (this links to vulkan in a PR state but it is the best chance you'll have at running on a Mac)

This guide will not help you any further as it's really not recommended. Please avoid using this unless you know what you're doing
