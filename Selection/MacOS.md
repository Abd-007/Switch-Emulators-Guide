## MacOS support is very limited. We recommend avoiding this due to lack of support from us, and the devs

However, if you still want to try it for any reason, you can download it at https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/pull/2518 (this links to vulkan in a PR state but it is the best chance you'll have at running on a Mac)

This guide will not help you any further as it's really not recommended. Please avoid using this unless you know what you're doing
