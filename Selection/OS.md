# Emulator Selection

This will ask you a few quesitons to see which emulator you should use

**Note: If you want to play online, we strongly recommend asking in the [guilded server](https://www.guilded.gg/i/2OOm9RX2). As the games supported by different GPU vendors can change drastically, which may cause issues if you use the wrong emulator for online play. **
