## Note

Ryujinx has a Vulkan API in the builds. It isn't merged to the main build yet but it can be downloaded as a seperate PR. This means it won't be fully up to date with Ryujinx's main builds. However, it does have Vulkan, and if you want to use Ryujinx, you should do so with the Vulkan PR

**Note:** The first comment will have the download links. Download the RELEASE version for your OS.
