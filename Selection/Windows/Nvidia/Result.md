[Ryujinx Guide](https://github.com/Abd-007/Switch-Emulators-Guide/blob/main/Ryujinx.md)

## Note

If you get low framerates, you might find yuzu better as it gives more performance. Remember, Ryujinx is still recommended as it is way more stable and supports a way larger list of games. A full list of differences given below. If you have a mid-high end PC, ignore this

## Differences between Yuzu and Ryujinx
**Yuzu**

**Pros:**
- Better performance, so It's ideal for weaker PCs

**Cons:**
- It's based off 3DS code, so both accuracy and stability are awful. This is being rectified over time
- They use code stolen from Ryujinx, and claim it as their own
- Gives performance via CPU hacks, which makes the stability even worse
- Devs focus on 1st party and popular games, so a lot of games are very buggy or unplayable.
- Limited Amiibo support
- Can't create mii characters
- Vulkan shaders are largely non-transferrable
- AMD GPU users experience graphical bugs Nvidia does not get

**Ryujinx**

**Pros:**
- Built from scratch, and actually emulates Switch hardware.
- Accurate (less bugs)
- Stable (less crashes)
- Can play a lot more games
- Has multiplayer support with other Ryujinx users (separate build).
- Full Amiibo support with everything built-in
- Has a built-in Mii creator

**Cons:**
- Slightly more demanding, as it doesn't rely on unstable hacks
- AMD support is very limited

**What do they both have?**
- Res scaling
- Support for almost any kind of controller (some require 3rd party software)
- OpenGL and Vulkan support
