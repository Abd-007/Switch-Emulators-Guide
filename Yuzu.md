# Yuzu Guide

***The guide will be split into several sections, you can use the Table of Contents to easily get to the section you need to***

## Section 1: Installing the Emulator

(Optional) Go to https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/ to download the latest mainline build. 

Get an Early Access build. Those generally work better than mainline and are more updated. You can get Early Access builds from our handy auto-updater or download them manually, if you want

**Auto Updater:** https://mostlywhat.github.io/128Bit-Yuzu-Installer/

**Github Source (for downloading manually):** https://github.com/Kryptuq/Yuzu-Early-Access-files/releases

**Note:** If you get the "msvcp140_atomic_wait.dll is missing" error when launching Yuzu from here, install this https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

Once you get either mainline or early access, you are done with this step

## Section 2: Installing keys
